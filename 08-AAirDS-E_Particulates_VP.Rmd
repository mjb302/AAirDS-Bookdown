# **PM~1~ and VP**

## Scatter plot of **PM~1~ and VP**

Vapour pressure affects aerosol evaporation and sequestration. Lets examine if there is a relationship between VP and **PM~1~**. We would expect drier air to increase evaporation and possibly also particulate levels (Figure [\@ref(fig:f81z)]{color="blue"} ).

```{r f81, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Scatter plot of  $PM_1$ $\\mu$g per m$^3$ and VP(kPa) observations, trend line as linear model"}
ggplot(iaq, mapping = aes(x=vp, y=pm1)) +
  geom_point(color= "cornflowerblue", alpha=.1) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(trans=scales::pseudo_log_trans(base = 10),
                     breaks = c(0,1,10,100,1000,10000)) +
  labs(y="$PM_1$ ($\\mu$g per m$^3$)",
       x="Vapour pressure (kPa)") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```
```{r f81z, eval=picturesonly, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Scatter plot of  $PM_1$ $\\mu$g per m3 and VP(kPa) observations, trend line as linear model"}

## **PM~1~** and **VP** in `timeVariance()`

As previously we will examine the `No HEPA` state when looking for correlations with particulates given the degree to which the values are lowered in the `HEPA` state (Figure [\@ref(fig:f82z)]{color="blue"} ).

```{r f82, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap = "Variation of normalised **PM~1~** concentrations for values less than 100 $\\mu$g per m$^3$ and VP by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations", cache=TRUE}
timeVariation(
iaq[iaq$spike2 == "<100" &
      iaq$HEPA == "No HEPA",],         #No HEPA state selected
pollutant = c("pm1","vp"),
cols = "cbPalette",
local.tz = "Europe/London",
normalise = FALSE,
xlab = c("hour", "hour", "month", "weekday"),
plot = TRUE,
)
```
```{r f82z, eval=picturesonly, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Variation of normalised **PM~1~** concentrations for values less than 100 $\\mu$g per m$^3$ and VP by hour of the day, day of the week, and month.

## **PM~1~ and VP** with `geom_point()` by `iaq$weekday` and `iaq$daytime`

Facet scatter plot by weekday and day or night (Figure [\@ref(fig:f83z)]{color="blue"} ).

```{r f83, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Hex plot of $PM_1$ less than $\\mu$g per m3 and VP(kPa) observations by weekend and daytime; points coloured by `HEPA` state. Trend line as linear model.", cache=TRUE}
ggplot(data=iaq2aBHrender,
       mapping = aes(x=pm1,
                     y=vp,
                     color = HEPA,
                     shape = HEPA,
                     linetype = HEPA)) +
  geom_hex(bins=30) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="lightblue1",high="darkblue",trans="log10") +
  facet_wrap(daytime~weekend~HEPA, ncol = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans=scales::pseudo_log_trans(base = 10),
                     breaks = c(0,1,10,100,1000,10000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)) +
  labs(x="PM_1 (ug/m3)",
       y="PM_10 (ug/m3)") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.5)
