# **Humidity & Vapour pressure** {#7.1}

## Vapour pressure {#7.2}

As well as monitoring particulates and carbon dioxide, the sensors also recorded air temperature and relative humidity (**RH**; %). However, as **RH** is a relative value which is a function of temperature and vapour pressure (**VP**), in order to perform meaningful analyses it was necessary to compute the **VP** signal from the temperature and **RH** signals. This was done using the equations (1) and (2) below from Alduchov OA, Eskridge RE: **Improved Magnus form approximation of saturation vapor pressure.** Journal of applied meteorology 1996, 35(4):601-609. [link](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/548871).

Saturated vapour pressure (**p~s~**) in kPa and T = air temperature in degrees Celsius: 

$$p_s = 6.11\times\ 10^{{7.5\times\ T}\over{T + 237.3}}$$

Vapour Pressure (**p~v~**) in kPa and $\phi~r~$ = relative humidity (%): 
$$p_v = {{\phi_r\times\ p_s} \over 100}$$

We will use these two equations to calculate a new variable `iaq$vp`
first by calculating **p_s_** into variable `iaq$svp`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
iaq$svp1 <- (iaq$temp*7.5)/(iaq$temp+237.29)
iaq$svp2 <- 10^iaq$svp1
iaq$svp <- 6.11*iaq$svp2

iaq$vp <- (iaq$hum*iaq$svp)/100
```

Here is a summary of the new `iaq$vp` variable:

```{r}
summary(iaq$vp)
```

## Vapour pressure in `timeVariance()`

To get an idea of the changes to *VP* over time and through the day and week we will use timeVariance() again to plot these by `HEPA` state (Figure [\@ref(fig:f73z)]{color="blue"} ).

```{r f73, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap = "Variation of **VP** (kPa) by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations", cache=TRUE}
timeVariation(
iaq2,
pollutant = "vp",
cols = "cbPalette",
local.tz = "Europe/London",
normalise = FALSE,
group = "HEPA",
xlab = c("hour", "hour", "month", "weekday"),
plot = TRUE,
)
```
```{r f73z, eval=picturesonly, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Variation of **VP** (kPa) by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations"}

```

## Relative humidity (**RH**) in `timeVariance()`

If we just plotted RH; i.e. not accounting for air temperature we would get (Figure [\@ref(fig:f74z)]{color="blue"} ):

```{r f74, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap = "Variation of **VP** (kPa) by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations", cache=TRUE}
timeVariation(
iaq2,
pollutant = "hum",
local.tz = "Europe/London",
cols = "cbPalette",
normalise = FALSE,
group = "HEPA",
xlab = c("hour", "hour", "month", "weekday"),
plot = TRUE,
)
```
```{r f74z, eval=picturesonly, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Variation of **VP** (kPa) by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations"}

```

## **VP** & **RH** in `timeVariance()`

If we just plotted RH; i.e. not accounting for air temperature we would get (Figure [\@ref(fig:f75z)]{color="blue"} ):

```{r f75, eval = rungraphs, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, fig.cap = "Variation of **VP** (kPa) by hour of the day, day of the week, and month. The plots show the 95$\\%$ confidence intervals in the mean which are calculated through bootstrap simulations", cache=TRUE}
timeVariation(
iaq,
pollutant = c("hum","vp"),
cols = "cbPalette",
local.tz = "Europe/London",
normalise = TRUE,
